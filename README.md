# Programming_Exercises
This project is merely a repository of Code Wars exercise solutions. Most of them are written in Java and are named for the exercise the connect to.

I can be found on CodeWars.com as Mecha-Samzilla.

For now, this porject exists souly for archival purposes. Do not expect to be able to download it and run it.
